# ABOUT THE SCRIPTS
* **Clear background in all layers:** Clears the background in all layers (masters and copies) in all glyphs.
* **Clear background in all master layers:** Clears the background in all master layers in all glyphs.
* **Decompose all corner components:** Decomposes all corner components in selected glyphs.
* **Delete annotations in all layers:** Deletes all annotations in all layers (masters and copies) in all glyphs.
* **Delete annotations in all master layers:** Deletes all annotations in all master layers in all glyphs.
* **Display next layer:** Switches to the next layer of the current glyph within the current master.
* **Display previous layer:** Switches to the previous layer of the current glyph within the current master.
* **Duplicate current layer:** Duplicates the current layer as a normal glyph layer.
* **Make component glyph for all masters:** Builds compound glyphs in the selected ones for all masters.
* **Make lower-unicase font:** Makes a lower-unicase font placing the lowercase glyphs (as components) in the uppercasse cells.
* **New tabs with KernKing text:** Opens two new edit tabs and outputs KernKing text.
* **Scale background in selected glyphs:** Scale proportionally (user-definable percentage) the background content in selected glyphs.
* **Select partial path:** Selects the partial path between the selected nodes in the current glyph — take into account that the script goes through the path starting from the first node.
* **Select small paths:** Finds and selects small paths (smaller than a user-definable area) in the current glyph.
* **Selection to all the backgrounds:** Replaces in all the glyphs their current content of the background with the selected paths in the current glyph.
* **Set default figures:** Sets as default figures the set of numerals selected by the user (UI — Vanilla required). Inserts the figures as components in the ‘Decimal Digit’ cells, enables automatic alignment, and copies kerning groups.
* **Shift background in selected glyphs:** Shifts horizontally (user-definable number) the background content in selected glyphs. Positive vale for shifting to the right, negative value for shifting to the left.
* **Tabular width checker:** Checks all selected Glyphs are on same width. It ignores ‘Auto’ and makes sure that the assigned value is equal regardless of metrics keys.
* **Use layer as master:** Sets the current layer as the master layer.
