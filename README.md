* **Make zero handles selected glyphs:** Makes zero-length all handles (overlapping nodes) in selected glyphs.
* **Make zero handles selected nodes:** Makes zero-length all handles (overlapping nodes) in selected nodes.
* **New tab with glyphs between figures:** Opens a new tab and outputs selected glyph(s) between figures 0–9.

* **New tab with glyphs surrounded by I:** Opens a new tab and outputs selected glyph(s) surrounded by I string.
* **New tab with glyphs surrounded by nnonn:** Opens a new tab and outputs selected glyph(s) surrounded by nnonn string.
* **New tab with random numbers:** Opens a new tab and outputs random numbers.
* **New tab with random lowercase non-text:** Opens a new tab and outputs random lowercase non-text.
* **New tab with random lowercase words:** Opens a new tab and outputs random lowercase words sorted alphabetically.
* **New tab with random Title non-text:** Opens a new tab and outputs random title non-text.
* **New tab with random Title words:** Opens a new tab and outputs random title words sorted alphabetically.
* **New tab with random UPPERCASE non-text:** Opens a new tab and outputs random uppercase non-text.

* **Select different colour:** In Font view, selects glyphs with a different colour(s) as the currently selected one(s).
* **Select partial path:** Selects the partial path between the selected nodes in the current glyph — take into account that the script goes through the path starting from the first node.
* **Select paths:** Selects the path or paths you are working on—according to the selected nodes.
* **Select small paths:** Finds and selects small paths (smaller than a user-definable area) in the current glyph.
* **Selection to all the backgrounds:** Replaces in all the glyphs their current content of the background with the selected paths in the current glyph.
* **Set default figures:** UI (Vanilla required) for setting the set of numerals selected by the user as default figures. Inserts the figures as components in the ‘Decimal Digit’ cells, enables automatic alignment, and copies kerning groups.
* **Shift background in selected glyphs:** Shifts horizontally (user-definable number) the background content in selected glyphs. Positive value for shifting to the right, negative value for shifting to the left.
* **Simplify selection:** Simplifies the selected path(s) by deleting one of every two nodes.
* **Start-from-scratch:** UI (Vanilla required) for deleting anchors, annotations, backgrounds, guidelines, images, kerning groups, labels, metric keys, non-master layers, and paths and components—in selected/all the glyphs, selected/all the masters, and master/all the layers.
* **Tabular width checker:** Checks all selected Glyphs are on same width. It ignores ‘Auto’ and makes sure that the assigned value is equal regardless of metrics keys.
